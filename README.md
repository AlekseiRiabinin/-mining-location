# Location for Mining Well

## 1. Description
One of the more important aspects in oil field development is to assess the likely present-day worth and number of wells needed to achieve maximum profit. The research illustrates how to evaluate that goal in the light of uncertainties on selling price, field reserves, producibility and well development costs. Likewise, it is needed to decide where to drill a new well. The characteristics of oil samples from wells are collected: the parameters of mining wells and the volume of oil reserves in three regions. A model is built to predict the volume of reserves in new wells. Those with the highest calculated values are selected and regions with the maximum total profits are defined. Potential profits and risks are also analyzed.

## 4. Results
With regard to objectives, the outcome of the machine learning model represents the revenue depending on the location of oil wells. The most profitable location is Region 2 whereas Region 1 and Region 3 are equal. The highest risk of failure has Region 3. As a consequence, there must be some trade-off between potential revenue and unpredictable circumstances for business.
